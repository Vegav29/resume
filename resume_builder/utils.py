SKILLS_PROMPT = """ Your task is to extract relevant technologies, programming languages, frameworks, tools, and other technical skills from the CV provided (<CV_TEXT>). Ensure that the JSON output is professional, specific, and formatted for inclusion in a resume. Use the following rules:

### *Rules for Extraction*

1. *Categories*:
    - Languages: Include individual programming languages, listed specifically (e.g., "Python", "C++").
    - Frameworks: Include specific frameworks or libraries mentioned in the CV (e.g., "ReactJS", "Flask").
    - Technologies: Include specific technologies (e.g., "Azure", "AWS") and avoid grouping them under broad terms like "Cloud Computing."
    - Tools: Include specific tools and software used (e.g., "JIRA", "Jupyter Notebook").

2. *Formatting Rules*:
    - Do not group items into generic categories like "Cloud Computing" or "Profiling Tools."
    - Separate individual technologies (e.g., list "Azure" and "AWS" instead of "Cloud Computing (Azure, AWS)").
    - The output must be clear, concise, and structured for professional use.
    - Include a maximum of *6 items per category* to maintain brevity.

3. *Response Format*:
    Output must be in the following JSON format:

    json
    {
        "Languages": ["<Language1>", "<Language2>", ...],
        "Frameworks": ["<Framework1>", "<Framework2>", ...],
        "Technologies": ["<Technology1>", "<Technology2>", ...],
        "Tools": ["<Tool1>", "<Tool2>", ...]
    }
    

4. *Additional Guidance*:
    - Ensure the output is professional and polished.
    - Avoid redundancy (e.g., listing "Azure" and "Azure Services").
    - Use title case for proper nouns (e.g., "ReactJS" instead of "reactjs").
